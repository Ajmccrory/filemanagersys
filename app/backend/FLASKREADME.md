# File Management System - Backend Dev Info

## Overview
A robust REST API built with FastAPI that manages complex relationships between cases, evidence, and entities. The backend implements a clean architecture pattern with dependency injection and follows SOLID principles.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger)

## Architecture
- **Layer Separation**
  - Routes for API endpoints
  - Services for business logic
  - Repositories for data access
  - Models for database schema
  - DTOs for data transfer

- **Data Flow**
  - Request validation with Pydantic
  - Service layer business logic
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Response serialization

- **Features**
  - CRUD operations for all entities
  - Relationship management
  - File upload handling
  - Search and filtering
  - Pagination support

## Database Design
- **Schema**
  - Cases as primary entities
  - Evidence with file attachments
  - Entity relationships
  - User management
  - Audit logging

- **Optimizations**
  - Efficient indexing
  - Query optimization
  - Connection pooling
  - Lazy loading

## Security
- **Implementation**
  - JWT authentication (TBD)
  - Role-based access control
  - Input validation
  - SQL injection prevention
  - Rate limiting

## API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Consistent error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive documentation
- Versioning support

## Development Patterns
- Dependency injection
- Repository pattern
- Unit testing
- Error handling
- Logging and monitoring
